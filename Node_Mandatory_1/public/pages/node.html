    <p>
        Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. 
        A common use for Node.js is to create and run servers written in JavaScript.

    <h3>Setup and basics</h3>
    <p>
        You can download node.js here <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">this link</a>. 
        To check if Node has been correctly installed, open a terminal and type node --version. 
        If you see a version number, Node has been correctly installed.

    <h3>package.json</h3>
    <p>
        Package.json is a file formatted as JSON. The file can 
        contain dependencies, in which case the dependencies will be installed when you type <em>npm install</em> in a terminal. npm is 
        a package that was installed at the same time as Node.js. If you install a specific package via npm, the newly added dependency 
        will also appear in package.json. package.json can also include metadata about for example the name of your package, version and other 
        information. The file also contains the "main" property, which declares the main entry point of your package.
